**Project name**: Calculator website

**Description:** This calculator website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by displaying the calculation result from the script to the DOM. The project purpose is as a follow-up project for the "Calculator Project: JavaScript" course that I followed on FrontEndMasters. Almost 95% of the logic and the script is the same as the original course project.

But I add some additional features such as the current total value and decimals using a comma. I fix some minor bugs too such as can't process initial negative number, result display number is not reset after equals button is pressed or when the number is deleted to zero with backspace.

**Technologies used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Design inspiration:**
